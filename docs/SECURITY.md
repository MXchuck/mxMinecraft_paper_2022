## Code of Conduct
1. You must be a member of the Middlesex community in good standing with a verified account to access this server.
1. Though a virtual world, the Student Handbook considers Minecraft a place on campus; all school rules and norms apply.
1. While pranks and friendly mischief can be fun amongst friends, malicious griefing crosses a line and is not allowed. Anytime you are unsure, please employ empathy and ask how you'd feel if it happened to you, then apply [Wheaton's Law](http://www.wheatonslaw.com).

## Reporting community problems
Our Co-Captains, Jojo and Nick, along with several of our club members, are Senior Leaders and even Proctors. We trust their judgementÂ and rely on their leadership to determine if something is inappropriate and intervene, as they deem appropriate. Please reach out to them in game, if they are available, for immediate assistance.

You should also followup on any in-game issues with our club leadership via email.

Larger community issues at Middlesex are handled by the Deans of Students. Please report community issues to the Deans at \<deans@mxschool.edu\> and copy Chuck at \<cjmcdonald@mxschool.edu\>. You may also wish to speak with your Advisor and copy them on all related correspondence.
