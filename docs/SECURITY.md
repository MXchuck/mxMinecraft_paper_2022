1. Though a virtual world, the Student Handbook considers Minecraft a place on campus; all school rules and norms apply.
1. While pranks and friendly mischief can be fun amongst friends, malicious griefing crosses a line and is not allowed. Anytime you are unsure, please employ empathy and ask how you'd feel if it happened to you, then apply [Wheaton's Law](http://www.wheatonslaw.com).
