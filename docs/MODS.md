# Data and Resource Packs
Data Packs add or modify the way the game plays. These are applied server-side and affect the game for everyone. Resource Packs add or modify the game's sounds and textures. These are installed on the client-side by each player. Though encouraged, resource packs cannot be required.

### Morning Join (Data)
> Author: Chuck <br />
> If no one is connected to the server and it is night time when a player joins, the server will advance time to the next morning.

### mxMinecraft (Resource)
> Author: Chuck <br />
> Change the Mojang "Thing" to the Zebra server icon. This can be used on banners and shields. Dye the Zebra white to fill in the stripes correctly.

# Server Plugins
Server Plugins are Java Mods. These provide additional server-side functionality.

# Under Construction
These mods are in development or under consideration as possible future additions to our server.

### Bundles
> Author: Chuck
> Current state: Idea
> The 1.19 feature of bundles looks cool and might be do-able as a data pack. We are exploring this possibility.

### Insomnia
> Author: Chuck
> Current state: Idea
> This datapack would collect features we've used in other mods.
> 1. Track AFK players. Players who are AFK and OPs will not count against the sleep percentage.
> 2. Players who do not explicitly sleep are marked as Insomniacs.
> 3. When spawned, phantoms will only attack Insomniacs.
> 4. When spawned, phantoms will be 20% larger for each night an Insomniac has not slept.

### Rotten Flesh to Leather
> Author: VanillaTweaks.net
> Current state: Ready
> Smelt rotten flesh to get leather. This idea would pair nicely with the Bundles idea.

### Player Head Drops
> Author: VanillaTweaks.net
> Current state: Ready
> When you kill a player, their head drops as a trophy.
