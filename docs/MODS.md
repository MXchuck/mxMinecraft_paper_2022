# Data and Resource Packs
Data Packs add or modify the way the game plays. These are applied server-side and affect the game for everyone.
Resource Packs add or modify the game's textures and are installed on the client-side by each player. Though encouraged, resource packs are not required.

Change the Mojang "Thing" to the Zebra server icon. This can be used on banners and shields. Dye the Zebra white to fill in the stripes correctly.
