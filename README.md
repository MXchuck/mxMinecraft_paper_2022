## Version 1.18.1 - Caves and Cliffs: Part II
mxMinecraft runs Mojang's Java Minecraft Server v1.18.1, released on 10 December 2021.
- 1.18.1 is a minor update to Java Edition which makes minor changes related to fog and fixes bugs.
- 1.18 completely overhauls Overworld generation, with larger caves, taller mountains, new cave biomes, and flooded caves.

Server will launch on 17 December 2021

## Server Rules
1. Though a virtual world, the Student Handbook considers Minecraft a place on campus. Anything you say or do on our server will be treated the same as if you said or did it publicly in StuFac; all school rules and norms apply.
1. You must be a member of the Middlesex community in good standing with a verified account to access this server.
1. While pranks and friendly mischief can be fun amongst friends, malicious griefing crosses a line and is not allowed. Anytime you are unsure, please employ empathy and ask how you'd feel if it happened to you.

## Get Minecraft
To run Minecraft on your computer, you will need Java version 17 and a Minecraft launcher:
- [Java SE Development Kit 17.0.1](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
- Microsoft's [Minecraft Launcher](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/about-minecraft) or the OpenSource program [MultiMC.](https://multimc.org)

We are using the **Java** version of Minecraft, **not** the Bedrock version. <br />
Microsoft encourages you to migrate your Mojang account over to a Microsoft Account. They are offering a free cape as an incentive, if you do it now. **You will not be able to use your mxSchool email address for this;** please create a Microsoft account or use a personal gmail address.
[You can learn more about this migration from the Minecraft Help Centre](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4403181904525-How-to-Migrate-Your-Mojang-Account-to-a-Microsoft-Account)

Once you run Minecraft, choose multiplayer and add the multiplayer server URL: **minecraft.mxschool.edu**
