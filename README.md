## Get Minecraft
To run Minecraft on your computer, you will need Java version 17 and a Minecraft launcher:
- [Java SE Development Kit 17.0.1](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
- [Microsoft's Minecraft Launcher](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/about-minecraft) or the OpenSource program [MultiMC.](https://multimc.org)

We are using the **Java** version of Minecraft, **not** the Bedrock version. <br />
Please note that Microsoft will require you to migrate your Mojang account over to a Microsoft Account. Please create a Microsoft account or use a personal gmail address. You will not be able to use your mxSchool email address for this.

Once you run Minecraft, choose multiplayer and add the multiplayer server URL: **minecraft.mxschool.edu**

## Server Rules
- Though a virtual world, the Student Handbook considers Minecraft a place on campus. Anything you say or do on our server will be treated the same as if you said or did it publicly in StuFac; all school rules and norms apply.
- You must be a member of the Middlesex community in good standing with a verified account to access this server.
- While pranks and friendly mischief can be fun amongst friends, malicious griefing crosses a line and is not allowed. Anytime you are unsure, please employ empathy and ask how you'd feel if it happened to you.
