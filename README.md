- You must be a member of the Middlesex community in good standing with a verified account to access this server.
- While pranks and friendly mischief can be fun amongst friends, malicious griefing crosses a line is not allowed. Anytime you are unsure, please employ empathy and ask how you'd feel if it happened to you.
